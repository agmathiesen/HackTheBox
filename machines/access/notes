nmap yields: 
* FTP server on port 21
	Anonymous login allowed
* telnet on port 23
* MS IIS HTTP server on port 80

dirb on HTTP server yields:
* /aspnet_client/system_web	403: Access is denied
searchsploit on 'iis' yields only DoS for version 7.5 (not interesting)

The FTP server allows for anonymous login (username: anonymous, password: blank)
ftp 10.10.10.98 yields to directories:
* Backups
	backups.mdb (Microsoft Database file)
* Engineer
	'Access Control.zip' (requires password to unzip)

backups.mdb is corrupt if downloaded with regular FTP 'get' command
Can be obtained with wget:
	wget --no-passive ftp://10.10.10.98/Backups/backup.mdb
Can be browsed with mdb-sql:
	mdb-sql backup.mdb
	list tables
	go
Converted to SQLite DB (https://www.rebasedata.com/convert-mdb-to-sqlite-online)
Can now be browsed with GUI
Table 'auth_user' contains password for user 'engineer'
Since the 'Access Control.zip' file was obtained from the 'Engineer' share, it seems obvious
 to try unzipping the file with this password
This yields an Outlook email folder, which can be read using 'readpst'.
The resulting *.mbox is an HTML-file which can be read with a standard text editor.
We get the following email:
	'The password for the “security” account has been changed to 4Cc3ssC0ntr0ller' 

Login with these credentials using telnet and find the user flag:
	cd Desktop\user.txt
	ff1f3b48913b213a31ff6756d2553d38
